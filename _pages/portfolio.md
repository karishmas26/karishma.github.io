Here’s a selection of projects I’ve worked on at the intersection of data science, public health, and global development — spanning open-source tools, training initiatives, modeling workflows, and data visualization efforts. While much of the code was developed using version control within our team’s [GitHub organization](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/), most repositories remain private due to the nature of the work.
