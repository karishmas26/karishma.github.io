I am a data scientist and public health specialist who is deeply passionate about leveraging evidence and analytics for global impact.
I’ve spent the last several years at USAID, where I helped lead data science efforts for PEPFAR – the U.S. government’s flagship global health program and the largest initiative in the world targeting HIV/AIDS.

Throughout my tenure, I collaborated with governments and partners across more than a dozen countries to apply epidemiological modeling, geospatial analysis, and decision analytics to drive programmatic strategy for high-impact global health programs.
My work has supported HIV, tuberculosis, and other global health programs in over a dozen countries, with a focus on conducting rigorous analytics and statistical modeling, automating data workflows and reporting systems, and developing open-source tools to make data more actionable and accessible for cross-functional stakeholders.

I had the privilege to collaborate with a small group of data scientists who were passionate about advancing analytic tools, promoting data visualization for policy communications, and developing capacity-building efforts throughout the organization.
My colleagues and I have developed and maintained a suite of over 10 open-source R packages designed to standardize our data management processes, refine our data visualization practices, and promote reproducibility and interoperability in our workflows.

I am passionate about all things data science and data viz, particularly to leverage evidence and analytics to improve global and public health outcomes.
I am now exploring independent consulting and partnership opportunities – particularly at the intersection of data, health, and development.
If you’re seeking support in analytics strategy, statistical or epidemiological modeling, or strengthening data systems, I’d be thrilled to connect!
