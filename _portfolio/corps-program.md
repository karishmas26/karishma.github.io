The purpose of the coRps Learning Collaborative was to establish an inclusive and collaborative space within USAID’s Office of HIV/AIDS for analysts and data scientists to strengthen their capacity and proficiency in R. Our goal was to strengthen analytic capacity across the agency by sharing best practices in R, promoting collaborative learning, and reinforcing principles of reproducible, high-quality analysis.

We hosted biweekly sessions with up to 40 participants, covering topics ranging from R basics and workflow automation to geospatial analysis, package development, Git/GitHub, and unit testing. I co-designed and delivered a 12-part “R Building Blocks” series modeled after [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), adapted for our unique data context and internal packages.

We also developed an R Analyst User Guide to document standard practices for data access, storage, and workflow design,  serving both as a reference and onboarding tool. The collaborative helped foster a strong internal community of practice and contributed to a more open, reproducible analytic culture across the office.
