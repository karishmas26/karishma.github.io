As part of a broader effort to strengthen PEPFAR data reporting in USAID’s South Africa portfolio, I developed [**Tierdrop**](https://github.com/USAID-SA-SI/tierdrop/tree/main), an R package designed to automate the transformation of raw site-level data from Tier.Net (South Africa’s national HIV clinical database) into MER-aligned indicators for PEPFAR reporting.

Working closely with local partners, I designed scripts to standardize site-level data from Tier.Net, join metadata necessary for MER processing in DATIM (PEPFAR’s central database), build unit testings into the data flow, and prepare the output for downstream analysis and visualization. I led live training sessions with the implementing team, developed a full SOP to guide future use, and helped institutionalize the tool through documentation, versioning, and stakeholder onboarding. Tierdrop significantly reduced the burden of MER submission, strengthened the reproducibility of reporting workflows, and supported long-term transition planning for local ownership.

**Key Outcomes**

-   Built and deployed the TierDrop R package and accompanying SOP

-   Standardized and automated a high-priority, previously manual reporting workflow

-   Supported live data submissions across 8+ quarters through hands-on capacity building

-   Facilitated the transition of tool ownership to the South Africa DMR team
